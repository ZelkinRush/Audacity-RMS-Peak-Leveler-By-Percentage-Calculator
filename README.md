# Audacity-RMS-Peak-Leveler-Calculator
This is a cool automated calculator that allows you to enter peak height levels modifications from 1% to 100%. You can also add decimal points. You will then have to enter the dB level obtained from the Measure RMS result. Then it performs the necessary calculations. It also returns the dB level that should be used in loudness normalization. I originally wrote this for myself, but I decided to share the source. Simple beginner material. Audacity 3.3.3 for Linux was used for testing.
