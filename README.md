# Audacity-RMS-Peak-Leveler-Calculator
Simple Calculator that lets you pick peak compression level. Let's you enter a dB level
you get from Measure RMS result. Does the appropriate calculation. And returns what
dB level you're supposed to use in Loudness Normalization. I wrote this for myself, but then
I wanted to share the source. Simple beginner type stuff.
